## Getting familiar with Git and GitHub
This repository has been created to practice working with Git and GitHub.

## Testing branches
Made a new branch locally: git checkout -b branch-test ,
made changes and committed to the branch

## Merging branch
Finally, merged the branch branch-test into master
Switch to master branch and: git merge branch-test

## Undoing a Git and deleting a branch
Made some changes to README and reverted/undone the changes using git reset and after completion of all merges, deleted the branch using:
git branch -d branch-test
Deleted from remote repo(pushed changes on GitHub) using:
git push origin :branch-test
